The latest round of development on Convox represents a serious milestone. You can now install Convox in 4 regions around the world, and use the `convox` CLI to create apps that are connected to a production-ready RDS database that easily scale to whatever number and amount of memory you desire.

## Multi-Region

Thanks to [Robert Coleman](https://github.com/rjocoleman), you can now install convox in 4 regions around the world:

`$ convox install --region [us-east-1|us-west-2|eu-west-1|ap-northeast-1]`

These are the 4 regions where ECS and Lambda are available. Follow [PR 95](https://github.com/convox/kernel/pull/95) for progress towards every region in the world.

## Process Scaling

You can now scale process count and memory independently!

```
$ convox scale web --count 4 --memory 1024
$ convox scale worker --count 2 --memory 256
```

## Production Databases

You can easily create an production-ready RDS database.

```
$ convox services create pg1 postgres
$ convox services info pg1
Name   pg1
Status  running
URL     postgres://postgres::btFTHpZqwmCn88nhN(:@pg1.cbm068zjzjcr.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/app
```

When this is finished, set DATABASE_URL on your app environments. 

## CLI Cleanup

Lots of small features have been cleaned up in the CLI. Thanks [Nguyen Dang Minh](https://github.com/nguyendangminh) and [Hu Ming](https://github.com/ming-relax)!

## Update or Install Convox

If you're already running Convox, you can get the latest release by:

`$ convox system update`

If you're new to Convox, [read the docs](http://docs.convox.com/) to learn how to install Convox and deploy your first apps to production-ready infrastructure.
