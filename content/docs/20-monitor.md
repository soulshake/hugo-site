You've deployed your app and seen how to promote releases. The next goals are to:

- View, search, and filter logs
- Centralize logs with an external logging resource
- Monitor your app
- Analyze metrics

Let's start by [viewing logs](/guide/logs).

{% include_relative _includes/next.html
  next="View your app and rack logs"
  next_url="/guide/logs/"
