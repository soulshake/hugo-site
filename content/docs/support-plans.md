Convox offers several tiers of support. Your level of support is tied to your organizationâ€™s [Console](https://console.convox.com) plan.

## Developer (Free)

In the free plan you can get support from the Convox community via our [public Slack](https://invite.convox.com).

The Convox team also answers questions in public Slack, but responses are not guaranteed. This is a best-effort channel.

## Basic

Users in Organizations subscribed to the Basic plan can open support tickets via the Support tab in [Console](https://console.convox.com). All tickets will get a response from the Convox team.

## Pro

Users in Organizations subscribed to the Pro plan can open support tickets via the Support tab in [Console](https://console.convox.com). Tickets will get a response from the Convox team within 1 US business day. 

Pro organizations will also get a private chat room in which they can communicate directly with the Convox team. 

## Enterprise

Users in Organizations subscribed to the Enterprise plan can open support tickets via the Support tab in [Console](https://console.convox.com). Tickets will get a response from the Convox team within 1 US business day. Tickets marked as Urgent will page the on-call Convox engineer and are guaranteed a response within 1 hour.

Enterprise organizations will also get a private chat room in which they can communicate directly with the Convox team.
